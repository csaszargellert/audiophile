# Project Title

Audiophile

## Description

With a simple and intuitive interface, you can seamlessly browse through a collection of earphones, speakers, and headphones and add your favorite items to your virtual cart. When you're ready to make a purchase, I have made the process easy and secure by integrating Stripe which ensures your financial information is protected.
